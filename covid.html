  <h1 class="text">COVID-19</h1>
<br/>
  <h2 class="text">Variants</h2>
  <br/>
  <p class="text">The more COVID-19 spreads, the more difficult it may be to stop it, as new variants will develop due to mutations in the genetic code. These differences in the genetic code and in physical traits, such as resistance to treatments, result in the differentiation of one variant to another. </p>
 <br/>
  <h4 class="text">The CDC assigns variants to three groups:</h4>
</br>
<ul class="text">
  <li class="text">Variants of interest - variants which genetic traits indicate it could be more contagious, result in more severe symptoms, or be better able to evade immune responses.</l1>
<li class="text">Variants of concern - variants which are observed/detected as being more contagious, resulting in severe symptoms, having a likely chance of causing breakthroughs in vaccinated populations, and evading tests or treatments.</li>
<li class="text"> Variants of high consequence - variants which vaccines arenâ€™t effective against.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h2 class="text">Current Variants of Concern</h2>
<br/>
<h4 class="text">Delta</h4>
<br/>
<p class="text">The Delta variant was first identified in India, as a variant that would be more transmissible than previous ones.</p>
<br/>
<h4 class="text">Omicron</h4>
<br/>
<p class="text">The Omicron variant was first identified by scientists in South Africa during early November of 2021, and many are concerned that it is more contagious than the Delta variant, or any other previous variants. Due to it being discovered relatively presently it is unknown if it is more severe than other variants. However, data shows that breakthroughs in fully vaccinated individuals are possible, meaning that these individuals can still catch the Omicron variant and spread it to others. A recent study from The New England Journal of Medicine indicates that the current vaccine may be less effective against this variant and concludes that getting a booster shot will mitigate this lack of effectiveness; however, regardless of variant, being fully vaccinated prevents individuals from developing more severe symptoms. </p>
<br/>
<h2 class="text">How should we protect ourselves against new variants?</h2>
<br/>
<p class="text">Vaccines have been shown to be effective against severe reactions to a COVID infection; scientists believe that getting vaccinated will prevent severe hospitalization. Getting a booster shot will ultimately boost your immune response against these arising variants. It is also necessary that people continue to practice safety precautions such as wearing masks and frequently washing hands.</p>
